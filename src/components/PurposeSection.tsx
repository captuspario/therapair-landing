                Too many people have this experience. Finding a therapist who truly understands your identity, 
                background, and therapeutic needs shouldn't be a game of chance.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe that the right therapeutic relationship can be life-changing. That's why we're building 
                technology that considers not just availability and insurance, but cultural competence, therapeutic 
                approaches, and the unique aspects of who you are.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mental health care should be affirming, accessible, and tailored to you. That's the future we're creating.
