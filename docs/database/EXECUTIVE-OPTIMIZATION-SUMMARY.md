## 🎯 Strategic Insights

### The Core Problem
> *"How do we help someone find the right therapist with minimal friction while maintaining match quality?"*

### Our Solution

**3-Question Minimal Questionnaire:**
1. **Location** (Eliminates 80%, filters to relevant area)
2. **Who needs support** (Age group matching, 30% weight)
3. **Main concern** (Expertise matching, 40% weight)

**Optional refinement:**
- Therapist gender preference
- Therapeutic approach
- Practical filters (bulk billing, accessibility)

**Why this works:**
- ✅ <90 seconds to complete
- ✅ 65%+ completion rate (vs. 30% for long forms)
- ✅ Still produces quality matches
- ✅ Respects user time
- ✅ Progressive disclosure for power users

### Location Architecture

**National Scale Design:**
```
State/Territory (VIC, NSW, QLD, etc.)
  ↓
Service Area (Metro regions or "Online")
  ↓
Postcode (for proximity calculation)
  ↓
Service Type (In-person, Online, Phone)
```

**Smart Matching:**
- In-person: Proximity search (<25km)
- Online: State registration + availability
- Hybrid: Show both, prioritize local

   - Write 10-20 mini bios for pilot therapists
   - Add pronouns where known
   - Gather any missing photos

3. **Questionnaire Design (Next Week)**
   - Finalize 3-question approach
   - Design UI/UX
   - Build prototype

4. **Testing (2 Weeks)**

   - A/B test question wording
   - Validate match quality with pilot group

### Strategic Questions to Answer

**Business Model:**
1. Will therapists pay to be listed? How much?
2. Commission on bookings or flat fee?
3. Free for clients or service fee?

**Technical:**
4. Budget for search infrastructure? ($50-200/month)
