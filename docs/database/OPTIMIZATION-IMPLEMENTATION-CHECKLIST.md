## 📋 Phase 2: Next 2 Weeks

### Questionnaire Design

- [ ] **Review questionnaire design** in optimization strategy
  - Location → Who → Main Concern → Preferences (optional)
  
- [ ] **Decide on approach:**
  - [ ] Option A: Minimal 3-question quiz (recommended for MVP)
  - [ ] Option B: Progressive disclosure (3 + refinement)
  - [ ] Option C: Full filtering (Psychology Today style)

- [ ] **Map database fields to questions**
  - Location → State + Service Area + Service Type
  - Who → Client Age Groups
  - Main Concern → Primary Expertise
  - Preferences → Modalities + Gender + Accessibility

### Matching Algorithm

- [ ] **Define matching weights:**
  - Primary Expertise: 40%
  - Age Group: 30%
  - Modality: 15%
  - Gender: 10%
  - Lived Experience: 5%

- [ ] **Test match scoring** with scenarios:
  - Client seeking trauma support (LGBTQI+, Melbourne)
  - Teen needing ADHD support (online, NSW)
  - Couple needing relationship therapy (Brisbane)

- [ ] **Document edge cases:**
  - No matches found (expand criteria)
  - Too many matches (how to narrow)
  - Equal scores (how to prioritize)

---

## 📋 Phase 3: Next Month

### Profile Templates

- [ ] **Create Notion page template** (per NOTION-PROFILE-PAGE-TEMPLATE.md)
  - Set as default for all new entries
  - Test with pilot therapists
  - Gather feedback

- [ ] **Design public profile page** (web)
  - Use structure from optimization strategy
  - Include booking CTA

### Data Quality

- [ ] **Audit existing data:**
