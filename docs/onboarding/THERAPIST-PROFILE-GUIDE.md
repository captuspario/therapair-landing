# 📝 Therapist Profile Guide
**How to Create an Effective Therapair Profile**

---

## ✍️ Writing Your Mini Bio (150 characters)

Your mini bio appears on search result cards. Make it count!

### The Formula

```
[Your Approach] [Qualification] with [Experience] supporting 
[Who You Help]. I use [Methods] in a [Your Style/Space].
```

### ✅ Great Examples

**Example 1: Trauma Specialist**
```
"Trauma-informed psychologist with 12 years helping LGBTQI+ survivors. 
I use EMDR in a warm, shame-free space."
(138 characters)
```

**Example 2: Relationship Counselor**
```
"Person-centered therapist specializing in ENM relationships and 
intimacy. I use Gottman Method with humor and compassion."
(129 characters)
```

**Example 3: Neurodiversity Focus**
```
"ADHD-affirming psychologist (I have ADHD too!) supporting late-diagnosed 
adults with practical tools and understanding."
(123 characters)
```

### ❌ Avoid These Mistakes

**Too Generic:**
```
"I am a registered psychologist who works with a range of issues 
including anxiety, depression, and relationships."
```
*Problem:* Sounds like everyone else, no personality

**Too Long/Rambling:**
```
"I have been working as a clinical psychologist for over 15 years 
and during this time I have developed a special interest in working 
with people experiencing trauma, particularly those from the LGBTQI+ 
community, and I use a range of approaches..."
```
*Problem:* Gets cut off, loses reader

**Too Vague:**
```
"Creating a safe space for healing and growth."
```
*Problem:* Doesn't say what you actually do or who you help

## 📄 Writing Your Full Bio (500 characters)

Your full bio appears on your profile page. Tell your story.

### Structure

```
Paragraph 1: Who you are + Your approach (100-150 chars)
Paragraph 2: Who you work with best (100-150 chars)
Paragraph 3: How you work / Your style (100-150 chars)
Paragraph 4: Your experience / Background (100-150 chars)
```

### ✅ Great Example

```
I'm a clinical psychologist specializing in trauma-informed care for 
LGBTQI+ individuals and sexual assault survivors. My approach centers 
your lived experience and honors your resilience.

I work best with folks who've tried traditional talk therapy and want 
something more body-based and experiential. Many of my clients are 
navigating identity, sexuality, or recovery from complex trauma.

I primarily use EMDR, somatic experiencing, and parts work (IFS). 
Sessions are collaborative—you're the expert on you. I bring warmth, 
directness, and the occasional dark humor.

I've been practicing for 15 years, including 7 years at the Victorian 
Pride Center. I'm queer and neurodivergent, which informs my work.

### 💡 Tips

1. **Use "I" statements** - Be personal, not clinical
2. **Be specific** - "LGBTQI+ folks" not "diverse clients"
3. **Show personality** - Use your actual voice
4. **Mention lived experience** - If comfortable sharing
5. **Explain your methods** - But keep it accessible (no jargon)
