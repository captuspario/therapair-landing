## 🔄 Data Sync Process

### From Notion to JSON

```bash
cd /Users/tino/Projects/therapair-matching-journey
npm run sync-therapists
```

**What happens:**
1. Connects to your Notion database
2. Fetches all 202 therapists
3. Filters to valid entries (193 with email + name)
4. Transforms to clean JSON
5. Saves to `src/data/therapists.json`

**When to sync:**
- After making changes in Notion database
- Before deploying updates
- Daily in production (automated cron job)
