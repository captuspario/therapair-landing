## 🎓 Key Learnings (MVP Phase)

### What Worked Well

1. **Vanilla JavaScript Decision**
   - Zero framework overhead = instant load times
   - Easy to debug, easy to deploy
   - No build tools = faster iteration

2. **Partnership-First Approach**
   - Unison gave us real therapists, real users
   - Credibility boost (not just a demo)
   - Valuable feedback loop

3. **AI Email Personalisation**
   - Users love personalized confirmations
   - Sets professional tone immediately
   - Differentiates from generic autoresponders

4. **Identity-First Messaging**
   - LGBTQIA+/neurodivergent focus resonates
   - Clear differentiation from competitors
   - Strong word-of-mouth potential

### What We'd Do Differently

1. **Earlier Documentation**
   - Should have written exec summary sooner
   - Documentation helps clarify thinking
   - Essential for fundraising conversations

2. **Automated Testing**
   - Manual testing is slow and error-prone
   - Should have added Playwright from start
   - Critical before multi-clinic deployment

3. **Email Deliverability**
   - PHP mail() is unreliable
   - Should have used SendGrid from start
   - Migration needed before Phase 2

4. **Analytics From Day One**
   - No user behaviour tracking yet
   - Missed opportunities to understand drop-offs
   - Need Google Analytics 4 + Mixpanel

## 🏆 What Makes This Special

**Therapair isn't just another directory or booking platform.**

We're building the future of therapy matching—where AI understands identity, values cultural competency, and continuously learns from outcomes. We're making finding the right therapist feel like magic, not a chore.

**Current directories make you read 200 profiles and guess.  
Therapair asks 9 questions and intelligently guides you to the right person.**

**This is just the beginning.** 

From here, we'll add:
- Outcome-based matching (learning from real therapeutic results)
- Agentic workflows (proactive support, intelligent scheduling)
- Global reach (10M+ people matched)
- Research partnerships (publishing efficacy studies)

**We're not building a tool. We're building a movement.**

A movement toward mental health care that truly understands you.
