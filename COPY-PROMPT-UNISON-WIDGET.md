# Copy Rewrite Prompt for Unison Widget Section

## Context
Therapair is a therapist matching platform. The landing page has a section showcasing how Therapair is being used by Unison Mental Health as a real-world example.

## Current Copy Issues
- The section currently uses "demo" language
- Doesn't clearly communicate that Therapair is primarily a standalone platform
- Doesn't emphasize customization capabilities for practices/companies

## Requirements for New Copy

### Key Messages to Communicate:
1. **Primary Purpose**: Therapair is primarily a standalone therapist matching platform
2. **Customization**: Can be customized for companies and practices to serve individual, customized functions
3. **Real Example**: The Unison widget is a real, live example (not a demo) showing how Therapair can be used for small therapy practices
4. **Flexibility**: Emphasize that Therapair can work as:
   - Standalone platform (primary use case)
   - Customized for small practices (like Unison)
   - Customized for larger organizations
   - Customized for individual, specialized functions

### Tone & Style:
- Professional but approachable
- Clear and direct
- Emphasize real-world application, not theoretical demo
- Show flexibility and adaptability of the platform

### Sections to Update:
1. **Section Heading** (if there is one)
2. **Main Description** (currently: "See a list of therapist matches who align with your preferences, identity, and therapeutic needs")
3. **CTA Button Text** (currently: "See the live example")
4. **Disclaimer/Info Text** (currently: "This is a live example of Therapair in action with Unison Mental Health, customised for a small practice team. Therapair as a product can support small practices, larger organisations, or run as a standalone platform.")

### Current Text to Replace:
- Line 555: "See a list of therapist matches who align with your preferences, identity, and therapeutic needs"
- Line 602: "See the live example"
- Line 611: "This is a live example of Therapair in action with Unison Mental Health, customised for a small practice team. Therapair as a product can support small practices, larger organisations, or run as a standalone platform."

## Output Format
Provide:
1. New copy for the description text (line 555 area)
2. New CTA button text (line 602 area)  
3. New disclaimer/info text (line 611 area)
4. Any suggested section heading improvements (if applicable)

Keep the copy concise, clear, and aligned with the key messages above.
