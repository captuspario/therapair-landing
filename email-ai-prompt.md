- Less is more - be concise
- Don't make it obvious it's AI-generated
- Natural, human tone

### **Tone:**
- Professional yet approachable
- Warm without being overly friendly
- Confident and reassuring
- Brief and to the point

### **Length:**
- 80-120 words total
- 2-3 short paragraphs maximum
- Quick acknowledgment + next steps

---

## üìß Email Structure

### **Paragraph 1: Brief Acknowledgment** (1-2 sentences)
- Simple thank you
- Light acknowledgment of what they mentioned (don't go deep)

### **Paragraph 2: Next Steps** (1-2 sentences)
- How you'll stay connected (product updates, launch news)
- What they can expect (no immediate response promise)

### **Sign-off:**
```
Warm regards,

Therapair Team
```

## ‚ùå BAD Examples (Avoid This Style)

### **PROMISING MATCHING (Wrong - We're Not Matching Yet!):**

```
Hi there,

Thank you for your interest! We'll match you with therapists who specialize 
in LGBTQ+ care and trauma support. Our AI will find the perfect therapist 
for your needs...

[DON'T promise matching - we're just gathering interest!]
```

**Problems:**
- ‚ùå Promises matching (we're not ready yet!)
- ‚ùå Sets wrong expectations
- ‚ùå Not acknowledging this is research phase

---

### **TOO ENTHUSIASTIC:**

```
Hi there,

Thank you SO MUCH for reaching out to Therapair! We're THRILLED you're 
taking this important step! I can see that finding LGBTQ+ affirming care 
and trauma-informed support is REALLY important to you. These are incredibly 
valid needs, and I want you to KNOW that we have amazing therapists who 
specialize in exactly these areas and truly understand the unique experiences...

[Way too long, too enthusiastic, sounds AI-generated]
```

**Problems:**
- ‚ùå Too many exclamation points
- ‚ùå Overly excited tone
- ‚ùå Goes too deep into analysis
- ‚ùå Too long (sounds like marketing copy)
- ‚ùå Obviously AI-generated

---

### **TOO FORMAL/COLD:**

```
Dear Sir/Madam,

We acknowledge receipt of your form submission. Your request will be 
processed according to our standard procedures.

Regards,
Therapair
```

**Problems:**
- ‚ùå Too formal/corporate
- ‚ùå No warmth
- ‚ùå Doesn't acknowledge their interests
- ‚ùå Sounds automated (bad way)
