# ✅ Email Fix Complete - Using Verified Domain

## Changes Made

### Updated Sender Email

**Before:**
- Sender: `onboarding@resend.dev` (unverified/test domain)

**After:**
- Sender: `contact@therapair.com.au` (verified domain ✅)

---

## Why This Fixes the Issue

1. **Domain is Verified** ✅
   - `therapair.com.au` is verified in Resend
   - Can send to any email address

2. **Matches Research Campaign Setup** ✅
   - Research uses: `user-research@therapair.com.au`
   - Form uses: `contact@therapair.com.au`
   - Both use verified domain

3. **No More 403 Errors** ✅
   - Using verified domain email
   - Resend will accept emails to any recipient
   - Emails will appear in Resend dashboard

---

## Email Configuration

**Form Submission Emails:**
- **From**: `Therapair Team <contact@therapair.com.au>`
- **Reply-To**: User's email (for admin) / contact@therapair.com.au (for user)
- **To**: 
  - Admin notification → `contact@therapair.com.au`
  - User confirmation → User's email address

---

## What Happens Now

✅ **Form submissions will:**
1. Send via Resend API using verified domain
2. Work for all email addresses (no restrictions)
3. Appear in Resend dashboard
4. Have reliable delivery

---

## Test It

1. **Submit the form** at: https://therapair.com.au/#get-started
2. **Check Resend dashboard**: https://resend.com/emails
   - Should see the emails there!
3. **Check inboxes**:
   - Admin email: `contact@therapair.com.au`
   - User email: (whatever email they submitted)

---

## Status

✅ **Deployed and Ready!**

The form submission now uses the verified domain email just like the research campaign. All emails should now:
- ✅ Work via Resend API
- ✅ Show in Resend dashboard
- ✅ Deliver reliably

**Everything is set up correctly now!** 🎉
